Summary: How this website was made.

Designing this blog has been a bit of an adventure and I wanted to share it.

Where to start?  

### Direction


Well, the first thing I needed was a bit of direction on what this website would be about.  The basic theme was relatively simple, I have a number of other projects and I wanted a space to talk about the creative process I was/am going through, but I wanted this space to be a bit more than that.  I wanted personality.  I'm a programmer, a designer, and a scientist and I wanted each of those to be communicated without compromising the other.  Tough.

I sat on it awhile.  I knew I wanted to show a tiny bit of fun programming, specifically animations in the browser using SVG, and that sort of led me to looking into cogs and gears.  Conceptually, this made a few dimensions of sense.  I could have my little programming sub project in making the animations, it's not hard to jump from the visual of gears to science, and lets face it, they're just fun.




So, I made <this small gear library>, using D3.js, <this example>, and a random gif I found online of an asymmetrical planetary gear configuration.

But, there was a bit of a problem.  The gears were cool, but they weren't enough by themselves.  In fact, the gears weren't just cool, they seemed a bit cold and I had no idea how to address that.

So, again, I sat on it, or rather, I had the luxury to sit on it.  My brain was chewing on the problem.  I had no deadlines, really, this was a personal project.  That can be a good or a very bad thing.

Some months later, I bought a gold-painted, resin-molded elephant head on etsy.  

If that sounds random, it is and thats the point, because that's how I broke out of the slump.  Literally, as I spilled packing peanuts pulling the faux gold elephant face out of the ups box, I remember turning to my girlfriend and saying "I should just call the website 'the Mechanical Elephant that remembers everything Matthew Griffith has done".

Click.  There it was.  Warmth.  It had a face(though he looks a bit angry).  It had resonances in contemplation with the memory of elephants.  The gears could be those thoughts, churning in the Elephant's head.  It now felt like a living character I was working with now and his name happened to be Mortimer.

I sketched Mortimer from a picture on my phone, while on a flight out to California . 

The rest of the design happened quickly.  

### Color

I had recently found [the bee collection](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/usgsbiml/), which I really loved, the color just stunned me.  I extracted the colors from one of my favorites using this website<> and added that to the styling sheet palette.  To maintain a tight communication of functionality, I made the color communicate "hey, this is clickable".

### Backgound Texture

Hard to go wrong with subtlepatterns.com.  I wanted the main body to have a white background, so I darkened one of the patterns to maintain a good balance of dark and light.

### Typography

The subject of typography goes all the way down, but basically I wanted both a serif font to communicate a feeling of older, authoritarian science, with feelings of marble and ancient libraries.  And a sans-serif for a modern feel to balance that out.  I ended up with ____  and Open Sans.

Making things superbly readable is easy.  
Basically, you do this to your CSS/LESS/SASS:

<pre>.readable {
		width:        700px;
		line-height:  1.2em;
		font-size:    18px;
}</pre>


### And so...

What did I contribute here?  Most everything was taken from somewhere else, iterated on, recombined.  I contributed the glue and the frequent, vague feeling that something wasn't working.  That feeling developed into reflection, observation and sheer frustration.  And it kept me moving and searching for what could patch it up.


Buying the elephant head was a quirky whim.  I think if I were to sum up what I would take away from this whole experience, it's to cultivate those whims.  Those whims might become part of your creative pallet some day.

All in all, I feel it was hard work for an honest thief.

And I'm happy with it.
