<span class="run-in">I'm fascinated by </span> using technology 
to create. 

As a developer, I mostly work with Haskell, Python, 
and the whole kit and caboodle of the browser frontend. I've done a fair share of Java and PERL as well.

As a designer, I love whitespace.  Probably a bit too much.  
I mean, look at this site, it's everywhere.  It's disgusting.  

As a writer, I still put two spaces after a period, 
which my friend says I should stop.  I wait for two pauses 
before responding to him when he does this.

When I'm not coding, designing, or science-ing, 
I'm usually rock climbing, reading, or cooking.
Chemistry you can eat!  You're even supposed to...
