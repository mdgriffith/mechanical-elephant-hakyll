<span class="run-in"><span class="drop">I</span>'m fascinated by </span> using technology to create.  

As a developer, I work with Haskell, Python,
and the whole kit and caboodle of the browser frontend. I've done a fair share of Java and PERL as well.

As a designer, I love whitespace.  Probably a bit too much.  I mean, look at this site, it's everywhere.  

It's disgusting.

When I'm not coding, designing, or science-ing,
I'm rock climbing, reading, or cooking.


This site uses Hakyll, the Haskell static site generator.
The source code is on [github](https://github.com/mdgriffith/mechanical-elephant).
